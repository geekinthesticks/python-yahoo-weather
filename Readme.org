* Using the Yahoo Weather RSS Feed.
This program shows how you can use Python to get weather information
from the Yahoo RSS need. Note this example uses and undocumented
Yahoo url that returns five days of weather, whereas the official url
only returns three days of weather.

For more information see that Yahoo developer documentation at
http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/.


The example program has the location hard coded into it. Information
on Yahoo location codes can be found at
http://edg3.co.uk/snippets/weather-location-codes/united-kingdom/ (UK
only) and
